Homework:
3. Squash and stretch really help things come alive.  Build squash and stretch into one of our particle simulations.  When a particle collides, it should squash, and when it's flying at high speed, it should stretch!  Pay attention to which direction it squashes and stretches.  You may want to make particles bigger so it's easier to see.
